    <title>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)</title>
        <!--SVG defines vector-based graphics in XML, which can be directly embedded in HTML pages.
        SVG graphics are scalable, and do not lose any quality if they are zoomed or resized
        SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
        SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web
        SVG defines graphics in XML format
        Each element and attribute in SVG files can be animated
        SVG is a W3C recommendation
        SVG integrates with other standards, such as CSS, DOM, XSL and JavaScript-->

            <!--Differences Between SVG and Canvas
            SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics in XML, while Canvas draws 2D graphics, on the fly (with JavaScript).

            SVG is XML based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers to SVG graphics.

            In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.

            Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser. If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic.

            Comparison of SVG and Canvas
            The table below shows some important differences between Canvas and SVG:

            SVG	                                   Canvas
    Resolution independent
    Support for event handlers
    Good text rendering capabilities
    Slow rendering if complex
    Not suited for game applications
                                            Resolution dependent
                                            No support for event handlers
                                            Poor text rendering capabilities
                                            You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
                                            Well suited for graphic-intensive games
