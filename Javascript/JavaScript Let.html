    <p>The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015) <br>

        Variables declared with let have Block Scope <br>
         <br>
        Variables declared with let must be Declared before use <br>
        
        Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope</p>

        <div>
            <p><h2>Block Scope</h2>
                Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope. <br>
                
                JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope. <br>
                
                ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const. <br>
                
                These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:</p>
                <p>
                    Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

                    {
                      let x = 2;
                    }
                    // x can NOT be used here
                </p>
                <p><h2>Global Scope</h2>
                    Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.<br>

                    Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope:

                    Variables declared with varinside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block:

                    {
                      var x = 2;
                    }
                    // x CAN be used here
                </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Redeclaring a Variable Using var</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var  x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{  
var x = 2;
// Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 2
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Redeclaring a Variable Using let</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let  x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{  
  let x = 2;
  // Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 10
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

        </div>

        <div>
            What is Good? <br>
            let and const have block scope. <br>

            let and const can not be redeclared. <br>

            let and const must be declared before use. <br>

            let and const does not bind to this. <br>

            let and const are not hoisted. <br>

            What is Not Good? <br>
            var does not have to be declared. <br>

            var is hoisted. <br>

            var binds to this.
