        Variables are Containers for Storing Data <br>
        JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways: <br>

        Automatically <br>
        Using var <br>
        Using let <br>
        Using const
    </div>
    <p>In this example, x, y, and z are undeclared.</p>
<p>They are automatically declared when first used.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"The value of z is: " + z;
</script>


<di>
    Note <br>
The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. <br>

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015. <br>

The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers. <br>

<div>
    When to Use var, let, or const? <br>
1. Always declare variables <br>
 <br>
2. Always use const if the value should not be changed <br>

3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects) <br>

4. Only use let if you can't use const <br>

5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.
